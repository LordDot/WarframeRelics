# WarframeRelics
WarframeRelics helps you pick rewards from relics by providing usefull information.

The displayed information is:

- The name of the item
- Prices on warframe.market

## How does it work?
WarframeRelics takes a Screenshot of the reward screen and uses OCR to determine the rewards you can choose from. Afterwards the warframe.market api is used to determine the prices.
